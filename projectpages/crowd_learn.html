	  Our goal is to harness the power of the crowd for solving
	  problems in a variety of domains such as privacy, education
	  and image processing.  In the context of privacy, we develop
	  an approach to identify privacy norms based on crowd
	  responses to a series of multiple choice questions that
	  reflect their expected privacy preferences.  In the facial
	  expression modeling project, our methodology employs
	  crowdsourced, free-response expression labeling of images of
	  our 3D avatar followed by natural language processing
	  techniques to determine synonymous responses. Finally, in
	  the context of education, we design a collaborative platform
	  which leverages the vast amount of educational resources on
	  the Web and allows teachers to create, share and rate
	  content and generate annotated lesson plans to improve the
	  quality of learning in the classroom.

        <p><b><a href="http://nyunetworks.com/Pubs/miface.pdf">Crowdsourced Facial Expression Mapping Using a 3D Avatar</a></b></p>
	<p>Facial expression mapping is the process of attributing
	  signal values to a particular set of muscle activations in
	  the face. This paper proposes the development of a broad
	  lexicon of quantifiable, reproducible facial expressions
	  with known signal values using an expressive 3D model and
	  crowdsourced labeling data.  Traditionally, coding muscle
	  movements in the face is a time-consuming manual process
	  performed by specialists. Identifying the communicative
	  content of an expression generally requires generating large
	  sets of posed photographs, with identifying labels chosen
	  from a circumscribed list. Consequently, the widely accepted
	  collection of configurations with known meanings is limited
	  to six basic expressions of emotion. Our approach defines
	  mappings from parameterized facial expressions displayed by
	  a 3D avatar to their semantic representations. By collecting
	  large, free-response label sets from naïve raters and using
	  natural language processing techniques, we converge on a
	  semantic centroid, or single label quickly and with low
	  overhead.</p>

	<p><b><a href="https://privaci.github.io/">Privacy through Contextual Integrity</a></b></p>
        <p>
	  Designing programmable privacy logic frameworks that
	  correspond to social, ethical, and legal norms has been a
	  fundamentally hard problem. Contextual integrity (CI)
	  (Nissenbaum, 2010) offers a model for conceptualizing
	  privacy that is able to bridge technical design with
	  ethical, legal, and policy approaches. While CI is capable
	  of capturing the various components of contextual privacy in
	  theory, it is challenging to discover and formally express
	  these norms in operational terms.
	  
	  <!-- There is often a fundamental mismatch between programmable -->
          <!-- privacy frameworks, on the one hand, and the ever shifting -->
          <!-- privacy expectations of computer system users, on the other -->
          <!-- hand. Based on the theory of contextual integrity (CI), our -->
          <!-- paper addresses this problem by proposing a privacy -->
          <!-- framework that translates users' privacy expectations -->
          <!-- (norms) into a set of actionable privacy rules that are -->
          <!-- rooted in the language of CI. These norms are then encoded -->
          <!-- using Datalog logic specification to develop an information -->
          <!-- system that is able to verify whether information flows are -->
          <!-- appropriate and the privacy of users thus preserved. A -->
          <!-- particular benefit of our framework is that it can -->
          <!-- automatically adapt as users' privacy expectations evolve -->
          <!-- over time. -->
	  
	  <!-- To evaluate our proposed framework, we conducted an -->
          <!-- extensive survey involving more than 450 participants and -->
          <!-- 1400 questions to derive a set of privacy norms in the -->
          <!-- educational context. Based on the crowdsourced responses, we -->
          <!-- demonstrate that our framework can derive a compact Datalog -->
          <!-- encoding of the privacy norms which can in principle be -->
          <!-- directly used for enforcing privacy of information flows -->
          <!-- within this context. In addition, our framework can -->
          <!-- automatically detect logical inconsistencies between -->
          <!-- individual users' privacy expectations and the derived -->
          <!-- privacy logic. -->

        <p><b><a href="http://nyunetworks.com/Pubs/paper-ci2016.pdf">Crowdsourced Learning</a></b></p>
        <p> 
	  The conventional education ecosystem in developing regions
	  is plagued by the lack of good quality textbooks and
	  educational resources, lack of skilled teachers and high
	  variability across student skill and motivational
	  levels. This paper makes the case for establishing a
	  crowdsourced learning ecosystem that leverages the
	  collective intelligence of educators around the world to
	  design a collaborative platform [Arias et al. 2000] to
	  easily share, search, organize, rate and present educational
	  materials for teachers and students around the world. In
	  particular, we make two important contributions: (a)
	  Modeling learning outcomes in crowdsourced learning: We
	  propose a mathematical framework that enables systematic
	  modeling and comparison amongst different education
	  paradigms. Our framework provides a means to quantify
	  student learning under a given paradigm based on critical
	  factors such as the student skill (or ability), quality of
	  the reading material (or the teacher), etc. (b) Crowdsourced
	  Learning Platform: We describe the design of YeSua, an
	  initial prototype of our crowdsourced learning platform that
	  uses an inquiry-based framework for generating annotated
	  lesson plans for different subjects.
