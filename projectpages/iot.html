	<p>
	  There is a growing need for building urban informatics
	  platforms for addressing pressing urban problems such as
	  traffic, energy, pollution, etc.; all these platforms
	  typically require a geographical distribution of sensors and
	  actuators that aid in fine-grained data collection and
	  actuation. One of the fundamental challenges in building
	  such distributed IoT applications is the need for a high
	  bandwidth-low latency wireless backplane that can seamlessly
	  interconnect all these sensors and actuators especially when
	  the sensors and actuators could have high mobility, such as
	  in the case of traffic sensing. With the emergence of mmWave
	  backhaul technologies, one can effectively such a high
	  bandwidth-low latency backplane for IoT applications. Such a
	  backplane would need programmable control logic that sits in
	  the middle of the network to provide the right functionality
	  network primitives to IoT applications.

	<h2>SDN-Powered Platforms</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="contentText">
	<p>
	  We aim to build a unified underlying network platform for the
	  above applications and more. We believe Software-Defined
	  Networking (SDN) offers a rich class of primitives and a
	  control logic framework that can provide building blocks for
	  the type of platforms that we aim to build to
	  integrate. Current generation cellular networks, such as
	  AT&amp;T, are spending enormous resources on converting their
	  entire cellular infrastructure into a programmable platform
	  using SDN technologies.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p>
	  We envision a scenario where all IoT devices, sensors and
	  actuators will wirelessly interact with mobiles phones as the
	  intermediary sync points, which will in turn leverage the
	  cellular network to transmit all the control logic data
	  between the IoT sensors and the cloud infrastructure managing
	  these sensors.

	<h3>Examples</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="contentTitle">
	<h4>Traffic Management</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="contentText">
	<p>
	  As the first example, consider a futuristic intelligent
	  traffic management system where every traffic camera is
	  connected to a 5G-enabled mobile device which continuously
	  interacts with the cloud infrastructure instead of the status
	  quo of setting up a detailed wired infrastructure for every
	  camera end point.
	</p>
      </div>
      <div class="contentTitle">
	<h4>Energy Monitoring</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="contentText">
	<p>
	  As a second example, consider an intelligent energy management
	  application where all the energy sensors and actuators in a
	  house are controlled over a mobile interface and the mobile
	  device acts as the local sync point with the city-wide
	  centralized cloud energy manager.

      </div>
      <div class="contentTitle">
	<h3>Challenges</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="contentText">
	<p>
	  The existing cellular network infrastructure provides very
	  limited functionality for empowering such applications
	  especially due to the low latency, high bandwidth and QoS
	  requirements. Large-scale IoT applications continuously
	  generated large volumes of "tiny data" and the existing
	  scheduling mechanisms used in packet data gateways are not
	  suited to handle such traffic with applications experiencing
	  high congestion and latency. IoT applications also need
	  specialized control of flow management, flow-specific QoS
	  requirements. In specific cases such as video applications,
	  the network may need to handle different types of application
	  data types which may require data-specific processing
	  capabilities in the core network. All these factors motivate
	  the need for a general purpose substrate that an SDN framework
	  can easily enable.
	  
	  Thus, our focus areas are in i) efficient data acquisition,
	  assimilation and control, and ii) making the platform
	  programmable to be adopted for as many different types of
	  applications as possible.
