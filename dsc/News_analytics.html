        <p>Event extraction from unstructured data such as news
corpora can help many knowledge based systems including
building predictive models,  risk analysis applications, and enabling new policy making tools.
We propose a more generic framework to define and extract events
from a large news corpora. This new way of defining events is generic
and can capture different kinds of events which are not possible with the
existing frameworks.  
To have a complete coverage of events from a news corpora the representation
scheme of events needs to be more flexible and generic.
Our model assumes that every single news article is about 
one single event and from this assumption it automatically tries to learn
type of events from a large corpus of news articles.
Our model intuitively defines an event
as a combination of a central event the articles is describing and some
subsidiary events that have some association with the central event
and have been described in the articles. Based on the occurrences of
such events in the entire corpus our model learns the different event types
and the most likely subsidiary events. In addition, the model tries
to combine the more probable locations and time for an event.
Although many events are not dependent upon time and location,
it tries to associate the most likely set of locations and time based
on the past occurrences.

        Agriculture forms the backbone of several emerging economies. In the past few years,
			several agrarian regions have been severely affected, due to a
			combination of several factors including climate, lack of water
			availability, soil infertility etc. However, in reality, many
			policymakers and the general public are often unaware of the status of
			agricultural conditions across different localities within their
			countries. We have designed a system that automatically
			constructs a location-specific climatic and agricultural information
			aggregation and summarization portal based on disparate information
			sources from the Web. Given a location, the system searches the Web
			for information concerning different parameters influencing agriculture
			and climate and presents a summary of relevant information.</p> 

			<p> Our system is built around three key ideas. First, we (manually)
			identify target topics of interest within climate and agriculture
			(such as soil, water) and construct a list of appropriate search
			queries that comprehensively describe the different aspects of the
			target topic. Second, for each target topic (such as soil or water),
			we download the top search result pages and perform information
			extraction on the textual content of these pages. The information
			extraction process aims to extract the critical textual snippets
			that can capture the key trends within the target area. Finally, we
			perform  information summarization where the goal is to identify
			key trends corresponding to each target topic. We have tailored standard
			information retrieval techniques to address these problems. This
			summarized information on the location can be utilized to detect
			different problems and infer possible remedies from it. 
			Hence, the aim is to bring to fore the important as well as lesser known 
			facts, thereby increasing the availability of knowledge.

        Agricultural land availability is undergoing dramatic changes
across the globe. This phenomenon is more rampant in developing world where
rapid economic growth and increasing population is resulting in
unplanned development. 
Loss of arable land has a direct impact on food security. Most developing regions 
are also predominantly agrarian economies and changes in arable land can significantly
impact food production and availability. 
We developed an automated satellite image analytics tool
that can leverage publicly available satellite image data sources to provide a fine-grained longitudinal analysis of changes in land pattern in a given region.
Our goal is to design a data analytics system that can understand the longitudinal 
relationship between changes in agricultural land availability patterns in a given small geographic area and its corresponding impact on food production. 
This paper is specifically contextualized for the region of West Bengal, traditionally
considered one of the most fertile areas in the world being in the delta of the 
Gangetic plains.  We used a corpus of satellite images gathered from Google Earth, which maintains updated repository of satellite images along with archives of older images across the globe. Based on detailed food production data gathered in collaboration with
the bureau of statistics of West Bengal, we analyze the correlations
between changes in agricultural land patterns and corresponding changes in food 
production at fine-grained district granularities.

The key building block of our analytics tool is a satellite image analysis 
engine that can analyze potentially noisy satellite images and provide fine-grained
classification of regions within each image into different categories such as:
arable land, water body, developed land, forest etc. Given historical data 
about the same location, the image analysis engine can provide a detailed
analysis of land pattern changes. Our engine can detect such changes at different location granularities (small region, district, state level etc.). In the case of West Bengal,
we obtained data over a 13 year time period from 2000-2012 and could track land 
evolution over this entire time period. We correlate this land change pattern with 
food production data over the same time period gathered by the Bureau of Statistics in the
government. This tool can be helpful to policymakers 
to monitor the changes in the land pattern and take appropriate steps if 
any drastic changes are noticed.

        <h1 style="color:#57068c">Understanding Interest Volatility from FOMC Meeting Proceedings</h1>

        This study measures the effects of Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) communications on interest rates.
We find that, in recent years, the typical FOMC statement moved
mid-term interest rates by 1.1 to 2.8 basis points (bps) up or down.
If a press conference is held the day of the meeting, this movement
is 0.9 bps greater. Releasing meeting minutes three weeks later
only moves interest rates if the FOMC meeting was not followed
by a press conference, indicating that the press conference and
meeting minutes contain duplicate information. We propose this
measure of the volatility effect of the communication itself as a
check on the accuracy of text-mining methods that measure the
market effects of specific words or sentiments. Next, we identify
keywords describing sentiments conveyed and topics discussed in
FOMC meetings. Frequencies of these words appear to predict
interest rate movements in a regression context. However, two
pieces of evidence suggest that these regressions overfit the
interest rate data. First, the regression-predicted interest rate
movements far exceed the average market effects of an entire
statement or press conference. Second, if the frequencies of our
keywords summarize the market-moving content in the data—
as the regression results suggest—and if the press conferences
and minutes contain duplicate information—as our first results
indicate—then we would expect the keyword frequencies to be
correlated between the press conferences and minutes.
