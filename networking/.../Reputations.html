        <p>The growing popularity of online crowdsourcing services like Amazon Mechanical
Turk, CrowdFlower and citizen science projects like FoldIt, Galaxy Zoo have made it very
easy to leverage the power of the masses to tackle complex tasks that cannot be solved by
automated algorithms and systems alone. One of the most popular crowdsourced tasks is
data annotation for machine learning applications - image labeling, transcribing speech
etc. The goal here is to aggregate the responses from the crowd to determine the underlying (unknown) ground-truth of the data. However, these applications are vulnerable to
noisy labels introduced either unintentionally by unreliable workers or intentionally by
spammers and malicious workers. Therefore it is important to identify the underlying
"quality" of any worker so that we can determine which workers' labels we can trust. This
problem is challenging due to the following reasons: (a) Workers are often anonymous
and transient and might be difficult to track over time (b) Workers can have varying
expertise, beliefs, interests and incentives (c) Some tasks might be more difficult than
others so that the notion of quality might need to be task-specific.</p>
<br>
<p>We propose to address this problem via a reputation system for crowd-workers. Intuitively, a worker has high reputation if she performs the tasks "honestly" as opposed
to spamming or providing malicious labels. For instance, it has been shown that a lot
of workers complete the tasks in a short period of time by providing uniform or random
labels, just to earn the payment associated with completing the task. These workers
don't have any incentive to do the tasks diligently and are only motivated by the payment reward.
Further, in crowdsourced-review sites like Amazon, Yelp etc., businesses
have incentives to hire people to post fake reviews to boost up their own rating as well as
degrade the ratings of competitors. Both these kinds of workers should be assigned a low
reputation. Our goal is to design efficient algorithms for computing worker reputations
in crowdsourcing systems.</p>
