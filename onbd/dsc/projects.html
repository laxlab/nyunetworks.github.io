      <div class="contentText">
	<!-- <b><a href="News_analytics.html">Data-Driven Customer Segmentation</a></b> -->
	<p > Understanding customer behavior
	and preferences is one of the most important challenges for
	any firm, and involves problems like customer segmentation,
	modeling and predicting consumer choices as well as
	determining the impact of assortments and prices on consumer
	demand. Many of these problems have become increasingly
	important in the current age of Big Data, where firms have the
	ability to collect granular individual-level data at various
	points of interaction with the customer, both online and
	offline. Availability of such granular data allows a firm to
	greatly benefit from micro-segmentation of customers, leading
	to micro-targeting in the form of personalized product
	offerings, promotions, and recommendations. The existing
	approaches in the marketing and operations literature are
	incapable of scaling to such large amounts of data.Our goal is
	to propose alternative techniques for solving these problems
	that address some of the existing limitations: (1) provable
	guarantees on the quality of the obtained solution (2) robust
	to modeling assumptions and (3) fast and scalable to large
	amounts of data. Some of our techniques are inspired by recent
	work in the machine learning literature on large-scale and
	sparse optimization. </p>

	<!-- <b><a href="News_analytics.html">Event Analytics from News Data</a></b> -->
        <p > The goal is to understand
        important socio-economic indicators based on news and other
        data available on the Web. This involves using text mining
        techniques to extract events from online news articles and
        learning networks of real world events and show how such event
        networks can be used in the prediction of real-world social
        phenomena like drought, price variations and disease
        outbreaks. Our longer term vision is to build an automated
        analytics engine to learn and infer socio-economic phenomena
        from highly diverse and noisy data sources from the Web. </p>

	<!-- <b><a href="../projectpages/crowd_learn.html">Crowdsourced Learning</a></b> -->
	<p > The conventional education
          ecosystem in developing regions is plagued by the lack of
          good quality textbooks and educational resources, lack of
          skilled teachers and high variability across student skill
          and motivational levels. This paper makes the case for
          establishing a crowdsourced learning ecosystem that
          leverages the collective intelligence of educators around
          the world to design a collaborative platform [Arias et
          al. 2000] to easily share, search, organize, rate and
          present educational materials for teachers and students
          around the world. In particular, we make two important
          contributions: (a) Modeling learning outcomes in
          crowdsourced learning: We propose a mathematical framework
          that enables systematic modeling and comparison amongst
          different education paradigms. Our framework provides a
          means to quantify student learning under a given paradigm
          based on critical factors such as the student skill (or
          ability), quality of the reading material (or the teacher),
          etc. (b) Crowdsourced Learning Platform: We describe the
          design of YeSua, an initial prototype of our crowdsourced
          learning platform that uses an inquiry-based framework for
          generating annotated lesson plans for different
          subjects. </p>

	<p >
          The growing popularity of online crowdsourcing services like
          Amazon Mechanical Turk, CrowdFlower and citizen science
          projects like FoldIt, Galaxy Zoo have made it very easy to
          leverage the power of the masses to tackle complex tasks
          that cannot be solved by automated algorithms and systems
          alone. However, these applications are vulnerable to noisy
          responses introduced either unintentionally by unreliable
          workers or intentionally by spammers and malicious
          workers. Therefore it is important to identify the
          underlying <i>quality</i> of any worker so that we can
          determine which workers' responses we can trust.  We propose
          a novel reputation system for crowd workers based only on
          the responses submitted by the workers. Intuitively, a
          worker has high reputation if she performs the
          tasks <i>honestly</i> as opposed to spamming or providing
          malicious labels. For instance, it has been shown that a lot
          of workers complete the tasks in a short period of time by
          providing uniform or random labels, just to earn the payment
          associated with completing the task and hence, should be
          assigned a low reputation. Our goal is to design efficient
          algorithms for computing worker reputations in crowdsourcing
          systems that are robust to manipulation and able to
          detect <i>dishonest</i>
          workers.

	<!-- <a href="Satellite.html"><b>Satellite Image Analysis to Detect Changing Land Patterns</a></b> -->
        <p > Changing patterns in agricultural
        land availability is one of the fundamental problems that
        impacts food security in developing regions like India. We
        implemented a tool that can analyze satellite images of a
        region to compute temporal changes in land patterns for
        categories like arable, developed, water bodies etc. </p>

      <div class="contentText">
	<p>The Web has a wealth of educational information across
	different topics, which can potentially be used to improve
	teaching. In an attempt to harness this potential we developed
	a Contextual Information Portal(CIP) for education and
	deployed it in schools in Kenya and India. The portal crawls
	the Web and tries to collect documents for different subjects
	and creates a repository of relevant information. </p>
